		<p>
			Click on the button below to see all the available entities in the knowledge graph or to search for a specific one. Upon selection, all the connections will be displayed in an interactive graph. You can interact with the graph by clicking on a node, which will only display the most immediate connections in a subgraph. By selecting the same node a second time, the entire graph from the previously selected entity will be displayed. The edges between the nodes have different colors to distinguish how nodes are related: <br>
			Red: RelatedTo <br>
			Blue: UsedFor <br>
			Green: AtLocation <br>
			Purple: IsA <br>
			Grey: PartOf <br> <br>

			In addition, after clicking a node, additional information about the node will appear.
